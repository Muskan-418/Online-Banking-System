# Online-Banking-System
# Project Summary
Online Banking System is a web-based application that allows bank customers to perform banking operations through the internet without visiting a physical branch. The system provides features such as user registration, secure login, balance enquiry, fund transfer, transaction history, and profile management.

To reduce manual work and paperwork in bank branches.

# Scope of the Project
Customers can access their accounts using any internet-enabled device.
